      <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The
        Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request
        and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
        categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third
        parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the
        immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident
        and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
        writing to us using the contact information provided below.

        registered account with the App, you have the right to request removal
        of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request removal
        of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided

        not publicly displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may
        not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g.
        backups, etc.).
